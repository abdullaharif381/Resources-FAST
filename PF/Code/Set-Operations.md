## Introduction

The C++ Set Operations program allows you to work with two sets of unique integers (Set A and Set B). You can perform several tasks on these sets, including displaying, checking their relationship, and computing set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

## Usage

To use this program, simply compile and run the `main.cpp` file. It will guide you through the process of entering sets and performing various operations. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the program.

## Tasks

The program consists of several tasks, each of which is explained below:

### Task 1 - Entering Sets

In this task, you'll be prompted to enter two sets (Set A and Set B) of unique integers. The program ensures that no duplicate elements are allowed in the sets.

### Task 2 - Displaying Sets

This task displays the entered sets (A and B) and their sorted versions. The sets are sorted in ascending order.

### Task 3 - Checking Relationship of A and B

Task 3 checks the relationship between sets A and B. It determines if one set is a subset of the other and calculates the similarity index.

### Task 4 - Displaying Union Set of A and B

This task displays the union set of A and B, taking into account whether one set is a subset of the other.

### Task 5 - Intersection of Set A and B

Task 5 calculates the intersection of sets A and B and displays the result.

### Task 6 - Difference of Set A and B

Task 6 calculates the difference between sets A and B, both A - B and B - A, and displays the results.

### Task 7 - Cartesian Product of Set A and B

Task 7 computes the Cartesian product of sets A and B and displays the pairs.
